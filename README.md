# Monita iOS SDK

With Monita for iOS you can make sure that your tracking is going as you planned without changing your current analytics stack or code.

Monita will monitor traffic between your app and data destinations and automatically detect any changes in your analytics implementation and warn you about inconsistencies like hit drops, missing properties, rogue events, and more.


Monita is currently available for Web, iOS and Android. More clients will come soon.

Add MonitaSDKToken to Info.plist
Open your project in Xcode and navigate to your Info.plist file.
Add a new key called MonitaSDKToken with your SDK token as the value:

  `<key>MonitaSDKToken</key>`
  
  `<string>Your-Token-Here</string>`
  
  
Then in your application delegateâ€™s -  `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method, set up the SDK like so:

```swift
// AppDelegate.swift
import MonitaSDK
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    // Override point for customization after application launch.

    // Initialize Monita SDK
    MonitaSDK.configure(enableLogger: true | false, batchSize: 5, cid: "cid value", appVersion: appVersion)

    return true
}
```


Build and run your app.
The MonitaSDK should be successfully integrated, and it will initialize when the app is launched.
